## Maze Walker Program (Python)

I wrote this python program as part of a course I was taking to learn the langiage.

It is able to read in an image of a maze (like to would see in a kid's puzzle book) and provide a solution to it.

As this was a learning exercise, I'm sure it is not as efficient as it could be and the PyQt5 code is not the best but, if you find it useful/interesting, I would appreciate feedback.
